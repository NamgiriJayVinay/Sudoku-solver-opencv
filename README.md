# Sudoku-solver-opencv
Real time sudoku sover using tensor flow and opencv

The application will initially examine the sudoku grid by the inherent camera. At that point it will distinguish the game board by applying picture edge indicator. A sudoku game board contains 81 squares with number 1 - 9. The application need to distinguish the number and position of each square in the riddle. In the wake of perusing all numbers, it will ascertain the arrangement and show it back to the picture progressively. All arrangement numbers will append to comparing position of framework on the game board on screen even with slight development of cellphone.
